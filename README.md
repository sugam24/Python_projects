# 🐍 My Python Projects – 100 Days of Code (Angela Yu)

Welcome to my Python portfolio built through the **[100 Days of Code – The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)** by Dr. Angela Yu. This repository contains a collection of Python projects I developed day-by-day throughout the course to build hands-on experience in coding, debugging, and applying Python to real-world problems.

Each project represents a specific concept or skill learned, ranging from beginner syntax to advanced topics like APIs, web scraping, automation, GUI development, and Flask.
